# Practical Guide for Teachers (incl. Toolkit)

A small static website for a **Practical Guide for Teachers (incl. Toolkit)** on the responsible, effective and inclusive use of AI in educational practice.

The site is built with:

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS via CDN (for simplicity)
- Vanilla JavaScript with dynamic sections

## How to run locally

Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository on GitHub and upload `index.html` (and this `README.md` if you wish).
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the branch (for example `main`) and the root folder (`/`) as the publishing source.
3. Wait a few minutes, then open the URL shown in the GitHub Pages section of the settings.
